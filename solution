Cost Optimization of Billing Records in Azure Serverless Architecture
Problem Summary:
Your billing service stores over 2 million billing records in Azure Cosmos DB, with each record up to 300 KB. 
Older records (>3 months) are rarely accessed.This leads to high storage and RU costs.
You want to reduce costs without changing API contracts, ensuring zero downtime, and maintaining data availability (within seconds latency).

Solution Overview:
Approach: Tiered Storage with Fallback Logic
Keep recent records (< 3 months) in Cosmos DB.

Archive older records to Azure Blob Storage (Hot or Cool tier).

API remains unchanged â€” it first queries Cosmos DB; if not found, it fetches from Blob.
